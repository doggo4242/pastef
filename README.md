# pastef
A code formatting and pastebinning discord bot. Formats codeblocks and/or uploads them to a paste service when a message is reacted to with any pen emoji (formats) or a paperclip emoji (pastebins). 

# Install & Usage
Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/doggo4242/pastef
```

Enter the required info in the config files:

`whitelist.txt`: contains role ids of roles whose messages should be ignored by the bot (separate with newlines).

`channels.json`: contains a dict of json keys/values where the key is the channel id (as a string) of the channels the bot should be active in, and the value is the backup language specifier (accepts discord codeblock specifiers). Put "" for the key if you would not like to use backup language specification.

Build the image:

```
docker build . -t pastef --build-arg token=$TOKEN
```

Run the container:

```
docker run -d=true pastef
```

Done :)

Formatter supports everything clang-format and prettier support, as well as kotlin, python, php, rust, haskell, lua, asm, go, and ruby.
